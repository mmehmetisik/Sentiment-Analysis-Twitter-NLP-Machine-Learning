# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project delves into Natural Language Processing (NLP) by applying sentiment analysis techniques to Twitter data. Our objective is to demonstrate how NLP can be used to analyze, process, and extract valuable insights from social media text data, enhancing understanding and driving informed decisions.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Normalization**: Streamlining Twitter data for uniformity and clarity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discovering patterns and trends through visual data exploration.
- **Text Preprocessing Techniques**: Implementing methods like stopwords removal, rare words filtering, and lemmatization to refine text data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizing NLP techniques to determine the sentiment of tweets, categorizing them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Visualization**: Employing bar plots, word clouds, and other visual tools to illustrate the frequency and relevance of words in the dataset, as well as the distribution of sentiments.
- **Insights Extraction**: Deriving meaningful conclusions from processed textual data that can influence strategies and decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, NLTK, TextBlob, WordCloud, PIL, warnings
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
